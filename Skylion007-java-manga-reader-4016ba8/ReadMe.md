#Janga - A Java Manga Reader

##Description
Janga is a multi-platform manga reader written in Java. The program works by using content from the custom-written 
APIs.  Just type in the name of your favorite manga and be reading in seconds. 

The program works much faster than your browser because it only downloads the images and nothing else providing for 
a sleek, intuitive experience.
